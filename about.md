Hi, I am Segun Famisa. I am an Android developer.

I program in kotlin, java and sometimes, python.

I'm currently a Software Engineer at [trivago](https://trivago.com).

Previously I worked as a Consultant at [Andela](https://andela.com). I also worked on Android at [Truppr][truppr] and [KongaPay](https://kongapay.com)

I'm interested in `Android`, `public speaking`, `Software Engineering`, `research`, `artificial intelligence`, `computing` `robotics`, `IoT`

I am a Karateka. :D

I'm also an MVB at [Dzone](https://dzone.com/users/2842273/segunfamisa.html)
