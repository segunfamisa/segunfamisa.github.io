Hi guys, this is my first post using **jekyll** and also the first post on this blog.
So, after a long time, I finally decide to get a personal blog, to share my thoughts, and confusions.

I searched around for the coolest blogging platforms and bang! I ran into [**jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com/).
During my search, I found this [**repository**](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) of awesome jekyll templates. And I fell in love with the
[**gaya**](https://github.com/gayanvirajith/gaya) theme. Many thanks to [**Gayan Virajith**](http://gayan.me/) for the great work and making it free
to use :)

*Update*: I updated to a cooler theme (in my opinion) called [**leonids**](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids/)
