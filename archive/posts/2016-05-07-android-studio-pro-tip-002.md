Hey there, it's been a while. It's been a hectic few months for me. Things are softening
now anyway. Good to be back.

In this post, I'll be sharing a couple of protips. In case you missed the
last post in this series, you can check it out [here]({{site.url}}/posts/android-studio-protip-001).

1. First is the "Search Everywhere" shortcut. You probably know about this, but tapping
shift twice pops up a search box, where you can search for classes, methods etc.


2. Second is the autocomplete feature using the tab. Normally, when you're trying to
replace text such as method or class names, and the autocomplete options pop up, pressing enter will add
your option before whatever was there before as seen below:

However, using tab to select an option from the autocomplete list will replace the
previous value as shown below:

**TL;DR:**  
1. Use tabs to select from your autocomplete options list.  
2. Please share and drop any comments in the comments section below.
Thanks for reading :)
