Hi, I'm Segun. Everyone calls me SF. I'm a Software Engineer living in Berlin.

I have worked at [Delivery Hero](https://deliveryhero.com), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), [trivago](https://trivago.com), [Andela](https://andela.com) and [Konga](https://konga.com) in various IC functions, primarily focused on mobile applications.

I'm a [Google Developers Expert for Android](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-oluwasegun-famisa) and I'm active in the developer community.

My current tech interests are around building mobile applications (particularly Android), developer productivity - build systems, app performance - and systems programming. To do these, I use Kotlin, Java, C, C++ as the need arises. Kotlin is my current fave.

I'm a [musichead](https://soundcloud.com/segunfamisa), an adventure junkie and I recently started learning to take [photographs](https://unsplash.com/segunfamisa).

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). You can have a peek at my [resume here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txRHkfdq2dQ-adPze5xpPEQSXNA_cUZx1Ue8LMHhc_8/edit).
