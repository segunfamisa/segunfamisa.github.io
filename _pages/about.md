Hi, I'm Segun. Everyone calls me SF. I'm a Software Engineer living in Berlin.

I have worked at [Delivery Hero](https://deliveryhero.com), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), [trivago](https://trivago.com), [Andela](https://andela.com) and [Konga](https://konga.com) in various IC functions, primarily focused on mobile applications.

I'm a [Google Developers Expert for Android](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-oluwasegun-famisa) and I'm active in the developer community.

My current tech interests are around building Mobile Applications (particularly Android), Developer Productivity - build systems, app performance, and Systems Programming. To do these, I use Kotlin, Java, C, C++ as the need arises. Kotlin is my current fave.

I'm in the Computing Science graduate program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).

I'm a [musichead](https://soundcloud.com/segunfamisa), an adventure junkie and I recently started learning to take [photographs](https://unsplash.com/segunfamisa).
