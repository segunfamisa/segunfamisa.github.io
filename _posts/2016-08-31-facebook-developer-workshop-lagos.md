Yesterday, a friend sent me a picture of Mark Zuckerberg at my former office. I thought it
was a prank until I saw it on a [major tech blog in Nigeria](http://techcabal.com/2016/08/30/mark-zuckerberg-is-in-nigeria-right-now/).
Indeed Mark Zuckerberg, "The Zuck" was in Nigeria.

News has it that Mark came to visit Andela, a company that his foundation
[invested in](http://techcabal.com/2016/06/16/andela-has-raised-24-million-in-funding-from-the-chan-zuckerberg-initiative/),
and the tech community here in Lagos, as well as attend the Facebook Developer Workshop event.

I was able to attend the developer workshop, which was a strict invite-only event
for those that RSVPed. In retrospect, it all makes sense.

Ok, so, having watched videos and read blogs from a lot of experts
about how to engage and share content from conferences, with options like:
Sketchnoting, Live-tweeting, and writing a blog post to recap,
I decided to try out these things with the Facebook Developer Workshop.

# 1. Recap
First, here's a recap of what went down today.

### Keynote Address
The event kicked off with [Emeka Afigbo](https://twitter.com/nke_ise) doing the Keynote.

### Q&A with Mark
There was a Q&A session with Mark Zuckerberg. The whole room welcomed him with loud cheers
and he took questions from the room as well as from the live stream. Anyone who has attempted
a live Q&A will tell you, it's not a piece of cake, but Mark handled it perfectly as though it was scripted.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hayyyyyyy God <a href="https://t.co/ViWLuGq8i2">pic.twitter.com/ViWLuGq8i2</a></p>&mdash; SF (@segunfamisa) <a href="https://twitter.com/segunfamisa/status/770928396100595714">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

### Breakout sessions
There were breakout sessions on:

1. [Account Kit](https://developers.facebook.com/products/account-kit):
One of Facebook's products that helps reduce friction at login/registration point.
It provides Facebook login, password-less login among others.
2. [Bots & Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/products/messenger/):
a Facebook platform/product which businesses can use to reach out and engage their customers.
3. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native): Tool to build declarative UIs and
native mobile apps in iOS and Android. Learn once, write anywhere.

### React native
I attended the React-Native session, because I'd read about it and was looking forward to
learning more and trying it out.
The Session was anchored by [Christine ](https://twitter.com/abernathyca).
She did a pretty good job in walking us through the basics of react-native and what
we needed to know to get started.

### Food
The food was awesome. There was breakfast, coffee, tea, and lunch at the event.
The Nigerian Jollof I had tasted better than it looked:

# 2. Live-tweeting
I attempted live-tweeting the workshop, and the engagement was really impressive.

# 3. Sketchnoting
I also attempted to do sketchnoting. My first Sketchnote.
If you're curious about what it is, you can check
[here](http://coreylatislaw.com/sketchnoting-for-techies/).
I did the sketchnoting when Christine was talking about Open Source projects at Facebook.
Although, the Sketchnoting can be way better than this, I guess it's
not so bad for a first attempt. 🙈

Thanks [Moyin](https://twitter.com/moyheen), for encouraging to share it.

I am really grateful that I was able to attend the workshop.
I'm super excited that I saw Mark Zuckerberg, I mean, he was < 1m away from me :).
I hope to explore react-native further, and write about my findings soon.

I met new and old friends and colleagues, people I had only e-met via Twitter or Facebook.

Overall, it was a good experience for me. I'm looking forward to similar workshops in the future.

Thanks for reading.

Cheers,
Segun.
